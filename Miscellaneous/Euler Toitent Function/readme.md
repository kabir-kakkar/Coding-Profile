EULER TOITENT FUNCTION
============================

Given a number, calculate its Toitent Number by implementing a Euler Toitent Function, i.e., return the count of relatively prime numbers that fall in the range of n.

Input:

First line of input has t number of test cases.
t lines follows the number whose Toitent Number is to be calculated.

Output:

Print the Euler Toitent Function of n.

Example:

Input:

2
11
16

Output:

10
8
