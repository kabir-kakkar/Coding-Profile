Answers for GFG Quiz:

Q1. What is recurrence for worst case of QuickSort and what is the time complexity in Worst case?

Ans Recurrence is T(n) = T(n-1) + O(n) and time complexity is O(n^2)

Q2. Suppose we have a O(n) time algorithm that finds median of an unsorted array.

Now consider a QuickSort implementation where we first find median using the above algorithm, then use median as pivot. What will be the worst case time complexity of this modified QuickSort.

Ans. O(nLogn)

Q3. Which of the following is not a stable sorting algorithm in its typical implementation.

Ans. Quick Sort

Q4. Which of the following sorting algorithms in its typical implementation gives best performance when applied on an array which is sorted or almost sorted (maximum 1 or two elements are misplaced).

Ans. Insertion Sort

Q5. The maximum number of binary trees that can be formed with three unlabeled nodes is:

A. 5

Q6.  The number of leaf nodes in a rooted tree of n nodes, with each node having 0 or 3 children is:

A.  (2n+1)/3

Q7. A weight-balanced tree is a binary tree in which for each node, the number of nodes in the left subtree is at least half and at most twice the number of nodes in the right subtree. The maximum possible height (number of nodes on the path from the root to the furthest leaf) of such a tree on n nodes is best described by which of the following?

Ans. Log 3/2 (n)

Q8. A complete n-ary tree is a tree in which each node has n children or no children. Let I be the number of internal nodes and L be the number of leaves in a complete n-ary tree. If L = 41, and I = 10, what is the value of n?

Ans. 5

Q9. The time complexity of computing the transitive closure of a binary relation on a set of n elements is known to be:

Ans. O(n^3)

Q10. The most efficient algorithm for finding the number of connected components in an undirected graph on n vertices and m edges has time complexity.

Ans.  [theta(m + n)]
